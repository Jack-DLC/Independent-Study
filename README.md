#Independent-Study

This is a public repository containing all the programs needed to run and recreate my senior thesis. 

For my thesis, I am developing a game where in i have trained an AI (artificial intelligence) controlled player how to navigate through a procedurally generated course.
As part of my project, I will be investigating several topics including game development, procedural generation, diffent types and implementations of AI, and how to
train an AI agent. In tandem with the game, I will also be writting an in depth report detailing the following:
  * Related works. How other developers have gone about solving similar problems and what other types of studies and papres relate to this project.
  * problems presented by my project topic.
  * A discussion behind my methodology that will include:
    * A breakdown of the algorithms used to procedurally generate terrain.
    * A breakdown of the algorithm and implementation of the AI controlled player.
  * How these design decisions addressed problems presented by my project. Such as training a AI agent to navigate through a continually changing enviornment. 
  * Future works.
